##What is Cucumber?

* A framework for integration testing.
* Tests are written in a domain-specific language that is close to English and understandable by users and developers.
    * This allows the tests to be very similar to or synonymous with user stories or requirements.
* This style of testing is known as Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD).
* Cucumber originated in the Ruby community, but now works to test apps written in Java, .NET, Flex and web applications regardless of which language they are written in.

##Why is it Interesting?

* At my job, user-acceptance testing is often a process reminiscent of the movie "Office Space".
* A systems engineer writes a set of test cases in an elaborate SharePoint list.
    * In theory, the customers help write and approve the test cases, but they are noticeably less engaged when talking about test cases than when talking about new functionality.
    * In practice, the systems engineer mostly writes them with the customers then rubber-stamping them.
* Customers are then expected to test the application and mark each test case as passed or failed.
* Since the customers have real jobs to do, they tend to procrastinate this tedious task while the system engineer nags them to do it.
* As the deadline for deploying the release approaches, the systems engineer nags the customers more aggressively and schedules lots of follow-up meetings.
    * At this point, the customers usually give in and complete their testing or withdraw from the testing altogether.
* Meanwhile, while waiting for the testing process to complete the software development team is left with little to do (or some welcome time to devote to another project).
* This highly-inefficient process absurdly takes nearly as long as developing the software.
* The best solution to this problem would be to replace the whole testing process with a more agile approach.
    * But until management can be convinced of that, automating some of the user testing process could save a huge amount of time.
* In this project, I want to see if and how much Cucumber can help.
